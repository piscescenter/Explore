Dawlish is located about 13 miles from Exeter and whether people have lived there for months or years, they have nothing but praise for the area and have welcomed all of the latest additions like the new play park for children, and the ongoing seawall.<\/p>\n<p>Famous for its black swans, the Dawlish water is bursting with wildlife and is a buzzing and vibrant place to visit, while also having a nice community vibe. As you walk along the riverside, or the beach, there is always someone who will say hello or simply give you a smile that can really brighten up someone&#8217;s day.<\/p>\n<p>After visiting the quirky and quaint town, we discovered this is a brilliant place for all ages with its many attractions, from The Waterfowl to the town&#8217;s high street featuring mostly, friendly local businesses. Additionally, the new play park along the river came up in conversation often and appears to be a great new addition for families and holidaymakers.<\/p>\n<p>One resident, who has lived in Dawlish for more than 30 years, told us how the shop owners get to know you, compared the city life where you can be a &#8220;stranger.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Along the Dawlish river, we met Gillian Burgess, 54, who moved from Exeter to Dawlish, with her son aged 22, around four months ago. She told us that she would find it hard to move back to the big city after living in a small quirky town and praised it for being well looked after. Gillian was walking three dogs, who she was dog sitting, called Lulu, Rio and Daphne and also mentioned how welcomed she has felt by local business owners.<\/p>\n<p>A &#8220;picturesque&#8221; seaside town in Devon is loved by local residents, as well as visitors<br \/>\nA &#8220;picturesque&#8221; seaside town in Devon is loved by local residents, as well as visitors (Image: Zhara Simpson)<br \/>\nGillian told us: &#8220;I moved down from Exeter three to four months ago. I think the difference with Dawlish is that it&#8217;s really clean and tidy, and especially living opposite the waterway, the area, the pavements, the streets, the gardens are really well looked after. In Exeter they leave everything to grow on the sidewalks, it&#8217;s a hay fever city with pollen and bugs, but down here, it&#8217;s well looked after.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are so lucky because you have the waterway which you can walk alongside, and the beach literally two minutes away, so you have a choice. People in the area are also really friendly, having just moved in, some of the local business owners look out for you, I&#8217;ve had free chips and things like that, so there is that community feel as well.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve also noticed that there are a lot of people who do regular things, it&#8217;s the same faces who are going for breakfasts in the morning, there is just a nice community vibe. You notice on the bridge, there are things going on and there are events to take part in on the lawn, so there is a lovely community feel. It would be quite hard to move back to Exeter now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Gillian Burgess on her morning walk on the Dawlish Water<br \/>\nGillian Burgess on her morning walk on the Dawlish Water (Image: Zhara Simpson)<br \/>\nTalking about what it&#8217;s like to walk dogs in the area, she said: &#8220;There are so many different smells, they like the beach and they&#8217;re happy. Although we don&#8217;t have a garden anymore, the waterway is our garden now so we will come out and sit in the sunshine.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Dawlish has a quirky kind of charm, a really good community feel to it, very friendly and you have the beach. It gets very busy when the holiday makers are down here, you notice that and when you look out of your window, it&#8217;s like Exeter high street. I&#8217;ve experienced the Bank Holidays, but the thing is, with that, it&#8217;s still a nice vibe because people have come down to relax and enjoy. So it&#8217;s a place where you come to be happy. and even when it&#8217;s busy, there is still that nice vibe about it which is good.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Mum Kate lives in Dawlish with her partner and two children who are three and nine months old. She said the town is a great place for children to grow up and expressed how her family are fortunate to live in the little town, adding that it is picturesque.<\/p>\n<p>Kate explained: &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived in Dawlish for a couple of years now. It&#8217;s lovely, very quaint and there&#8217;s a real sense of community which is really nice and it&#8217;s a really lovely place for children to grow up.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Describing Dawlish, she said: &#8220;It&#8217;s very picturesque and it has everything you need on your doorstep. It has the park, the beach, and lovely cafes. The sun generally shines quite a lot, so it is lovely here.<\/p>\n<p>Discussing her favourite local businesses, she continued: &#8220;Le Cygne is really nice for coffee and beautiful food and Annie&#8217;s is amazing for supporting mothers and their children, and having such a welcoming space for your kids.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a really nice area, we feel very fortunate to live here. We&#8217;re happy here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Margret &#8216;Maggie&#8217; Meadows has lived in the beautiful town for 33 years, and said it has everything any resident could need, from shops to leisure. She also complimented the local community groups. She explained how nobody needs to &#8220;feel lonely&#8221; while living in Dawlish.<\/p>\n<p>Maggie told us: &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived in Dawlish since 1990. I love it here, it does everything for me, you&#8217;ve got shops, leisure, near a hospital, doctors, a theatre, museum, everything, in a small area, and the sea of course.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A picturesque seaside town in Devon is loved by local residents, as well as visitors.
