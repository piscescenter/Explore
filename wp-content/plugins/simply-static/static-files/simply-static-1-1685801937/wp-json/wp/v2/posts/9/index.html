We know that the best charities are hundreds of times more effective at improving lives than merely good charities; donating to these charities can hugely increase the amount of good that a donation can do.<br \/>\nLess suffering \u2014 tackling the most problematic problems upfront will result in the least human suffering.<br \/>\nHighlighting fact-based interventions can help to recruit rational donators who may previously have been reluctant to donate due to uncertainty of the good that their donation will do.<br \/>\nSecondary effects such as bringing visibility to charity efficacy, thus encouraging charities to justify the efficacy of their operations (and not just their operational efficiency).<br \/>\nDisadvantages<\/p>\n<p>Some effective causes, that currently lack evidence may be neglected.<br \/>\nDomestic efforts to serve those in need, may be neglected.<br \/>\nFeedback from EA donations can be less tangible than donations to or volunteering at domestic charities, reducing the feel-good factor associated with altruism. This has the potential to reduce donations.<br \/>\nFunding for advanced research funding for many (long-tail) diseases may decrease.<br \/>\nSmaller charitable endeavours which key EA organisations lack the resources to assess may be neglected.<br \/>\nPursuing a career in a lucrative industry in order to be able to give more in the future (a tactic sometimes suggested in EA) may result in no future donations and potentially net negative if the chosen industry is a force for social harm. Dissuading people from offering their support for a given cause in favour of a more impactful one can be counterproductive, leading them to feel disillusioned about charitable giving.<br \/>\nThe disadvantages of Effective Altruism are certainly valid concerns.<\/p>\n<p>However, as effective altruists we believe in impact.
